# Bingo Card Generator

Having struggled to generate custom bingo cards for a party I took the challenge on myself.  
Written in vanilla javascript, users can specify a title for their card and add an image then generate a specified number.  
They can download the cards as a PDF with the styling completed in such a way that the cards are the perfect size for landscape A4.  


# Next Steps

Improve UX  
- Generate the PDF document on a separate page rather than rendering onto the same page as the form  

Create a full scale bingo game  
- User can log in and have saved games
- Having saved the cards values it will know when to expect a bingo
